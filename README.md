Netty spring integration.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hermes-chat/spring-netty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hermes-chat/spring-netty)

# About
Mainly, the [Spring Netty](https://github.com/hermes-chat/spring-netty) project is created to solve Netty + Spring issues in [HermesChat](https://github.com/hermes-chat),
such as routing, Netty configurations as a spring beans etc...<br>
But because of it's clear architecture, it is completely separated from it's purpose and **HermesChat** use cases.

_**The library is still in heavy development, so unpredictable behavior and bugs may occur.**_
